A line is denoted by the x and y co-ordinates of the two end points.
The program must print the length of the line. 
Input Format: 
  First line will contain the x and y co-cordinates of 
  point 1 separated by a space. Second line will contain the x and y 
  co-cordinates of point 2 separated by a space
Output Format: The length of the line rounded up to two decimal places. 
  If there is no floating point representation then a .00 is to appear at the end of the output. 
  
  
Sample Input/Output: 
Example 1: Input: 
0 4 
3 0 

Output: 
5.00


#include<stdio.h>

int main()

    int x1,y1,x2,y2;
    scanf("%d %d\n",&x1,&y1);
    scanf("%d %d",&x2,&y2);
    int t1 = pow(abs(x1-x2),2);
    int t2 = pow(abs(y1-y2),2);
    float dist = sqrt((float)t1+t2);
    printf("%.2f",dist);
